# Lootbox Hero

Lootbox hero is a project tryign to kill (at least) three birds with one stone. Monstly,it's a game about what most games today are about, gridning for loot and spending real moeny to bypass the grind. It's also a project to get better with modern web app architecture (React and Node JS) and an example of my ability to make JS do my bidding.
